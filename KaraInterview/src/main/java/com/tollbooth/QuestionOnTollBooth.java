	/*
We are writing software to analyze logs for toll booths on a highway. This highway is a divided highway with limited access; the only way on to or off of the highway is through a toll booth.

There are three types of toll booths:
* ENTRY (E in the diagram) toll booths, where a car goes through a booth as it enters the highway.
* EXIT (X in the diagram) toll booths, where a car goes through a booth as it exits the highway.
* MAINROAD (M in the diagram), which have sensors that record a license plate as a car drives through at full speed.

/*
We are interested in how many people are using the highway, and so we would like to count how many complete journeys are taken in the log file.

A complete journey consists of:
* A driver entering the highway through an ENTRY toll booth.
* The driver passing through some number of MAINROAD toll booths (possibly 0).
* The driver exiting the highway through an EXIT toll booth.

For example, the following excerpt of log lines contains complete journeys for the cars with JOX304 and THX138:

.
.
.
90750.191 JOX304 250E ENTRY
91081.684 JOX304 260E MAINROAD
91082.101 THX138 110E ENTRY
91483.251 JOX304 270E MAINROAD
91873.920 THX138 120E MAINROAD
91874.493 JOX304 280E EXIT
.
.
91982.102 THX138 290E EXIT
92301.302 THX138 300E ENTRY
92371.302 THX138 310E EXIT
.

→ This log contains 3 complete journeys:
* JOX304: 1 journey
* THX138: 2 journeys

You may assume that the log only contains complete journeys, and there are no missing entries.

2-1) Write a function in LogFile named countJourneys() that returns how many
complete journeys there are in the given LogFile.
